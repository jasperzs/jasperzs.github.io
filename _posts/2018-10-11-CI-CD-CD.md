## 1. What is Continuous Integration?
Developers merge/rebase their changes to project's main branch as often as possible.
Their changes are validated by creating a build and then running a series of automated tests against the build.

## 2. What is Continuous Delivery?
It is an extension of CI to automate release process and therefore allows simple deploymentment by just clicking a button.

## 3. What is Continuous Deployment?
One step further than Continuous Delivery to remove button click by automatically releasing new changes as long as there is no failed test.

                    <li>Developers are notified once their changes break the build and can fix it before making any context switch</li>
                    <li>Testing costs are minimized as CI server can run many tests in seconds</li>
                    <li>QA team spends less time testing and can focus on quality improvements</li>
