What follows is an unexpected journey to some of the inner workings of Spring Boot. In particular, how it handles materializing POJOs from an incoming HTTP request. It all started with an innocent look at the Slack API‚Ä¶

All of the code mentioned in this post can be found in the slack-slash-command-example github repo.

I use Slack. A lot. I‚Äôm currently in 12 slack orgs. One of them is even a paid org! I thought I‚Äôd play around with the Slack API and I started with Slack Slash commands, as it seemed like the easiest point of entry.

I also live and breathe Spring Boot. It‚Äôs so easy to write APIs with Spring Boot, that this seemed like the most natural place to start. Here‚Äôs the simplest one-file Spring Boot API app:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class SlackApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SlackApplication.class, args);
    }

    @RequestMapping("/slack")
    public @ResponseBody Map<String, Object> slack(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> slackSlashCommand) {

        return slackSlashCommand;
    }
}
```

Thanks to the magic of Spring Boot and its creation of a fully executable jar, I can easily fire up this example:
> target/slack-slash-command-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

On Windows, you may have to run:
> java -jar target/slack-slash-command-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

I can hit my API like so (I am using HTTPie, a modern curl replacement):
```
http POST localhost:8080/api/v1/slack \
  token=token team_id=team_id team_domain=team_domain channel_id=channel_id \
  channel_name=channel_name user_id=user_id user_name=user_name \
  command=command text=text response_url=response_url

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 24 May 2017 14:39:48 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "channel_id": "channel_id",
    "channel_name": "channel_name",
    "command": "command",
    "response_url": "response_url",
    "team_domain": "team_domain",
    "team_id": "team_id",
    "text": "text",
    "token": "token",
    "user_id": "user_id",
    "user_name": "user_name"
}
```

NOTE: Contrary to the way the above command looks, the data is sent over as JSON with a Content-Type header of `application/json`.

Well, that was easy!

__EXCEPT, this doesn‚Äôt work with the Slack Slash Command API at all.__

Looking more closely at the API, I see that Slack does the POST with an old-school `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

‚ÄúOK‚Äù, I thought, ‚ÄúSpring Boot is pretty smart, let me try sending over the params as form input rather than JSON.‚Äù

I can hit my API again, with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` by simply adding `--form` to the command line:
```
http --form POST localhost:8080/api/v1/slack \
  token=token team_id=team_id team_domain=team_domain channel_id=channel_id \
  channel_name=channel_name user_id=user_id user_name=user_name \
  command=command text=text response_url=response_url

HTTP/1.1 415
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 24 May 2017 14:55:34 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
  "error": "Unsupported Media Type",
  "exception": "org.springframework.web.HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException",
  "message": "Content type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8' not supported",
  "path": "/api/v1/slack",
  "status": 415,
  "timestamp": 1495637734535
}
```

Hrmph. I‚Äôve gotten so used to modern APIs using JSON (ahem, Slack - what gives?) that I wasn‚Äôt sure how to handle regular old form input in an API. To the Google!

## 1. ModelAttributes, WebDataBinders and HttpMessageConverters - Oh My!
Turns out, Spring Boot creates Form beans with the WebDataBinder. Non-Form beans are created using an HttpMessageConverter. Spring Boot exposes the `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` which handles the JSON mapping magic.

First thing I wanted to do was to stop using `Map<String, Object>` datatypes and to make a proper model object. Using `Map<String, Object>` is a handy trick when you‚Äôre interacting with an external API and you‚Äôre not sure exactly what you are going to get from it. So, I created the `FormSlackSlashCommand` model:
```java
public class FormSlackSlashCommand {

    private String token;
    private String command;
    private String text;

    @JsonProperty("team_id")
    private String teamId;

    @JsonProperty("team_domain")
    private String teamDomain;

    @JsonProperty("channel_id")
    private String channelId;

    @JsonProperty("channel_name")
    private String channelName;

    @JsonProperty("user_id")
    private String userId;

    @JsonProperty("user_name")
    private String userName;

    @JsonProperty("response_url")
    private String responseUrl;

    ...
    // setters and getters
}
```

Hold on, there! If this POJO is used for Form handling, why all the `@JsonProperty` annotations? Well, I want to be able to return this POJO as JSON, with properties that conform to the Slack API. These annotations don‚Äôt get in the way of our Form processing in any way. We‚Äôll see how they come into play shortly.

Here‚Äôs an updated Controller:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class SlackController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SlackController.class);

    @RequestMapping(
        value = "/slack", method = RequestMethod.POST,
        consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE
    )
    public @ResponseBody FormSlackSlashCommand slack(@ModelAttribute FormSlackSlashCommand slackSlashCommand) {
        log.info("slackSlashCommand: {}", slackSlashCommand);

        return slackSlashCommand;
    }
}
```

Notice the `consumes` and `produces` attributes of the `@RequestMapping` annotation. This controller method will take HTTP Form input and respond with JSON.

The `@ModelAttribute` annotation ensures that the `WebDataBinder` is engaged to materialize the `FormSlackSlashCommand` object. Looks like we‚Äôre done! I‚Äôll just hit the endpoint again to make sure:
```
http -f POST localhost:8080/api/v1/slack \
  token=token team_id=team_id team_domain=team_domain channel_id=channel_id \
  channel_name=channel_name user_id=user_id user_name=user_name \
  command=command text=text response_url=response_url

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Thu, 25 May 2017 03:55:49 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "channel_id": null,
    "channel_name": null,
    "command": "command",
    "response_url": null,
    "team_domain": null,
    "team_id": null,
    "text": "text",
    "token": "token",
    "user_id": null,
    "user_name": null
}
```

What the what?!? Well, Spring Boot currently just doesn‚Äôt handle Form submissions as flexibly as it does JSON. It automatically handles the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù attributes, like `command`, `text`, and `token` using the corresponding setters in the `FormSlackSlashCommand`. But, there is no corresponding setter to deal with attributes like: `channel_id`.

I came up with three approaches to address handling Form input more flexibly with what‚Äôs currently on the truck for Spring Boot.

Below follows an explanation of these approaches, from my least favorite to most favorite (and, more importantly, from worst to best approach).

### 1.1 First Approach: Nasty Java, Automatic Marshaling

For, my first swipe at a solution, I wanted to have the least amount of additional configuration code. Rather than deal with custom converters, I wanted to hook into the existing `WebDataBinder`. To do this, I needed to break some Java syntax conventions. In order to keep the primary code ‚Äúclean‚Äù, I created a superclass for the sole purpose of properly materializing our Object in the controller.

I give you `AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand`:
```java
// workaround for customize x-www-form-urlencoded
public abstract class AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand {

    public void setTeam_id(String teamId) {
        setTeamId(teamId);
    }

    public void setTeam_domain(String teamDomain) {
        setTeamDomain(teamDomain);
    }

    public void setChannel_id(String channelId) {
        setChannelId(channelId);
    }

    public void setChannel_name(String channelName) {
        setChannelName(channelName);
    }

    public void setUser_id(String userId) {
        setUserId(userId);
    }

    public void setUser_name(String userName) {
        setUserName(userName);
    }

    public void setResponse_url(String responseUrl) {
        setResponseUrl(responseUrl);
    }

    abstract void setTeamId(String teamId);
    abstract void setTeamDomain(String teamDomain);
    abstract void setChannelId(String channelId);
    abstract void setChannelName(String channelName);
    abstract void setUserId(String userId);
    abstract void setUserName(String userName);
    abstract void setResponseUrl(String responseUrl);
}
```

The `FormSlackSlashCommand` class is the same as it was, except that now it extends `AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand`:
```java
public class FormSlackSlashCommand extends AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand {
  ...
}
```

Now, the `WebDataBinder` can handle incoming form parameters such as `team_id` thanks to the `setTeam_id` method.

Aside from a lot of boilerplate code, `AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand` has the drawback of violating Java method naming conventions.

On to the next approach!

### 1.2 Second Approach: Custom HandlerMethodArgumentResolver

u/sazzer posted the excellent suggestion of creating an `HandleMethodArgumentResolver` to materialize the Object in the controller. I hadn‚Äôt heard or read about a `HandleMethodArgumentResolver` prior to this and it turned out to be a solid approach.

Here‚Äôs the updated controller:
```java
public @ResponseBody SlackSlashCommand slack(SlackSlashCommand slackSlashCommand) {
    log.info("slackSlashCommand: {}", slackSlashCommand);

    return slackSlashCommand;
}
```

Notice that there‚Äôs no `@ModelAttribute` annotation. That‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt want the `WebDataBinder` to materialize the `SlackSlashCommand`. We‚Äôll have a custom `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver` do that for us.

Note: In order to exercise all of the approaches in the slack-slash-command-example, the `SlackSlashCommand` class is basically the same as the `FormSlackSlashCommand` class, except that it does not extend `AbstractFormSlackSlashCommand`.

Here‚Äôs the `HandleMethodArgumentResolver`:
```java
public class SlackSlashCommandMethodArgumentResolver implements HandlerMethodArgumentResolver {

    @Override
    public boolean supportsParameter(MethodParameter methodParameter) {
        return methodParameter.getParameterType().equals(SlackSlashCommand.class);
    }

    @Override
    public Object resolveArgument(
        MethodParameter methodParameter, ModelAndViewContainer modelAndViewContainer,
        NativeWebRequest nativeWebRequest, WebDataBinderFactory webDataBinderFactory
    ) throws Exception {

        SlackSlashCommand ret = new SlackSlashCommand();

        ret.setChannelId(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("channel_id"));
        ret.setChannelName(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("channel_name"));
        ret.setCommand(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("command"));
        ret.setResponseUrl(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("response_url"));
        ret.setTeamDomain(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("team_domain"));
        ret.setTeamId(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("team_id"));
        ret.setText(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("text"));
        ret.setToken(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("token"));
        ret.setUserId(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("user_id"));
        ret.setUserName(nativeWebRequest.getParameter("user_name"));

        return ret;
    }

    private boolean isNotSet(String value) {
        return value == null;
    }
}
```

The `supportsParameter` method determines whether or not the resolver will be used to return a particular Object, in this case, a `SlackSlashCommand`.

The `resolveArgument` method uses the `NativeWebRequest` to obtain all of the form parameters and create a `SlackSlashCommand` object.

The last piece of the puzzle is to ensure that Spring Boot uses this resolver. That‚Äôs handled in a configuration:
```java
@Configuration
public class SlackSlashCommandMethodArgumentResolverConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void addArgumentResolvers(List<HandlerMethodArgumentResolver> argumentResolvers) {
        argumentResolvers.add(new SlackSlashCommandMethodArgumentResolver());
    }
}
```

This is a solid approach. However, there‚Äôs a lot of manual labor involved in materializing the `SlackSlashCommand` Object. Also, it‚Äôs a little more idiomatic for a Spring Boot controller to have the `@ModelAttribute` or `@RequestBody` annotation on an Object that‚Äôs part of the request.

u/sazzer also suggested using reflection to easily convert the form parameters into setter methods on the object.

That led to my last and favorite approach.

### 1.3 Third Approach: Custom HttpMessageConverter

This approach has the least amount of boilerplate code and reuses existing components available to Spring Boot.

As I said toward the beginning of the post, there are a bunch of built in `HttpMessageConverter` classes. The most common one is the `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`, which handles JSON.

As you would expect of Spring Boot, it‚Äôs easy to create a custom `HttpMessageConverter`.
```java
public class SlackSlashCommandConverter extends AbstractHttpMessageConverter<SlackSlashCommand> {

    // no need to reinvent the wheel for parsing the query string
    private static final FormHttpMessageConverter formHttpMessageConverter = new FormHttpMessageConverter();
    private static final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @Override
    protected boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
        return (SlackSlashCommand.class == clazz);
    }

    @Override
    protected SlackSlashCommand readInternal(Class<? extends SlackSlashCommand> clazz, HttpInputMessage inputMessage) throws IOException, HttpMessageNotReadableException {
        Map<String, String> vals = formHttpMessageConverter.read(null, inputMessage).toSingleValueMap();

        return mapper.convertValue(vals, SlackSlashCommand.class);
    }

    @Override
    protected void writeInternal(SlackSlashCommand slackSlashCommand, HttpOutputMessage outputMessage) throws IOException, HttpMessageNotWritableException {

    }
}
```

The `readInternal` method takes an `HttpInputMessage` as one if its parameters. This is essentially a raw `InputStream` of the incoming form parameters.

At first, I thought I would have to manually read the stream and parse the query string. Gross! Then, I remembered that the existing `FormHttpMessageConverter` takes an incoming form and resolves it to a `MultiValueMap`.

Based on the Slack Slash Command API, I also knew that all I needed was a single value map. Line 14 of the above code takes care of that.

At this point, I could manually create the `SlackSlashCommand` object, like I did in the `SlackSlashCommandMethodArgumentResolver`. However, the available Jackson `ObjectMapper` is all ready to take a `Map` and materialize it to an Object for us. As a bonus, it will make use of the `@JsonProperty` annotations found in the `SlackSlashCommand` class. Whoa - that‚Äôs a lot of power in that one line on line 16!

Just two more bits tie this approach into a neat bow.

First, the controller method now needs to use the `@RequestBody` annotation so that the collection of `HttpMessageConverters` can be inspected and used.
```java
public @ResponseBody SlackSlashCommand slack(@RequestBody SlackSlashCommand slackSlashCommand) {
    log.info("slackSlashCommand: {}", slackSlashCommand);

    return slackSlashCommand;
}
```

Now, that looks like a proper Spring boot controller method!

We do need to register the custom `HttpMessageConverter` with Spring Boot. This is accomplished with a configuration as before:
```java
@Configuration
public class SlackSlashCommandConverterConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void configureMessageConverters(List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> converters) {
        SlackSlashCommandConverter slackSlashCommandConverter = new SlackSlashCommandConverter();
        MediaType mediaType = new MediaType("application","x-www-form-urlencoded", Charset.forName("UTF-8"));
        slackSlashCommandConverter.setSupportedMediaTypes(Arrays.asList(mediaType));
        converters.add(slackSlashCommandConverter);
        super.configureMessageConverters(converters);
    }
}
```

This instantiates our `SlackSlashCommandConverter`, ensures that it supports `x-www-form-urlencoded` requests and adds it to the list of `HttpMessageConverters`.

The only drawback of this approach is that the `@RequestBody` annotation is typically used for non-form based requests. However, I think that the `consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE` attribute makes it clear what‚Äôs going on.

### 1.3 The Best Approach of All

I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed our trek down workaround lane.

If https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13433 is implemented (Did I mention about voting on it?), then none of the above approaches would be necessary. You‚Äôd simply annotate your POJO in a similar way to `@JsonProperty` to indicate how to map incoming form params to its fields.

In your controller, you would simply use the `@ModelAttribute` annotation and you‚Äôd be done.

That would truly make Form handling as civilized as JSON handling already is in Spring Boot.
