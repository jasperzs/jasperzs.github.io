## 1. What is Bamboo CI Server
Bamboo is a CI server which can be used to automate the release management to create a CD pipeline.

CI is a methodology in which a build, unit tests and integration tests are automatically triggered, whenever code is committed to the repository, to integrate new changes into the existing code base.
As a result, it provides early 'fail fast' feedback on the quality of new changes.

Release management describes the steps that are typically performed to release a software application, including building and functional testing, tagging releases, assigning versions, and deploying and activating the new version in production.

## 2. What problems do Bamboo solve?
+ An automated, reliable, build and test process
+ Manage builds that have different requirements or targets
+ Automatic deployment to a server, such as the App Store or Google Play
+ Build and test processes are not dependent on a specific local environment.
+ Builds and integration tests are triggered automatically as soon as new code is commited
+ Optimize build performance through parallelism
+ Leverage elastic resources
+ Deploy continuously, for example to user acceptance testing (UAT).
+ Implement release management

## 3. How does Bamboo do this?
+ Bamboo is the central management server which schedules and coordinates all work
+ Bamboo itself has interfaces and plugins for lots of types of work
+ Bamboo first gets your source from a source repository, then it starts the build such as using Maven to call compiler
+ Once project is built, you have "artifacts" (build results, e.g. an executable app, config files, etc.).
+ Additional things can be done with the build artifacts:
    - zip them up into a ZIP file and copy them somewhere
    - run an install builder on them and create an MSI
    - install them on a test server to make sure everything installs just fine
+ Bamboo provides a web front-end for configuration and for reporting the status of builds

## 4. What does Bamboo need?
+ A code repository that contains the complete source code for the project.
+ Build scripts
+ Test suites

## 5. How is a Bamboo workflow organized?

![Bamboo Server Workflow]({{ site.url }}/img/ciCd/Bamboo/bambooWorkflow.png?raw=true)

__Project__:
+ Has none, one, or more, plans
+ Provides reporting (using the wallboard, for example) across all plans in the project
+ Provides links to other applications
+ Allows setting up permissions for all the plans it contains

__Plan__:
+ Has a single stage, by default, but can be used to group jobs into multiple stages
+ Processes a series of one or more stages that are run sequentially using the same repository
+ Specifies the default repository
+ Specifies how the build is triggered, and the triggering dependencies between the plan and other plans in the project
+ Specifies notifications of build results
+ Specifies who has permission to view and configure the plan and its jobs
+ Provides for the definition of plan variables

__Stage__:
+ Has a single job, by default, but can be used to group multiple jobs
+ Processes its jobs in parallel, on multiple agents (where available)
+ Must successfully complete all its jobs before the next stage in the plan can be processed
+ May produce artifacts that can be made available for use by a subsequent stage

__Job__:
+ Processes a series of one or more tasks that are run sequentially on the same agent
+ Controls the order in which tasks are performed
+ Collects the requirements of individual tasks in the job, so that these requirements can be matched with agent capabilities
+ Defines the artifacts that the build will produce
+ Can only use artifacts produced in a previous stage
+ Specifies any labels with which the build result or build artifacts will be tagged

__Task__:
+ Is a small discrete unit of work, such as source code checkout, executing a Maven goal, running a script, or parsing test results
+ Is run sequentially within a job on a Bamboo working directory
