## Context
You have applied the [Microservices architecture pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) and the [Database per service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html). As a result, it is no longer straightforward to implement queries that join data from multiple services. Also, if you have applied the [Event sourcing pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) then the data is no longer easily queried.

## Problem
How to implement a query that retrieves data from multiple services in a microservice architecture?

## Solution
Define a view database, which is a read-only replica that is designed to support that query. The application keeps the replica up to data by subscribing to [Domain events](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html) published by the service that own the data.

## Examples
My bookâ€™s FTGO example application has the __Order History Service__, which implements this pattern.

There are [several Eventuate-based example applications](http://eventuate.io/exampleapps.html) that illustrate how to use this pattern.

## Resulting context
This pattern has the following benefits:
- Supports multiple denormalized views that are scalable and performant
- Improved separation of concerns = simpler command and query models
- Necessary in an event sourced architecture

This pattern has the following drawbacks:
- Increased complexity
- Potential code duplication
- Replication lag/eventually consistent views

## Related patterns
- The [Database per Service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) creates the need for this pattern
- The [API Composition pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html) is an alternative solution
- The [Domain event](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html) pattern generates the events
- CQRS is often used with [Event sourcing]

- The book [Microservices patterns](https://microservices.io/book) describes this pattern in a lot more detail.
