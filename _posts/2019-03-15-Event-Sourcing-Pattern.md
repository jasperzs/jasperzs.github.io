## Context
A service typically need to atomically update the database and publish messages/events. For example, perhaps it uses the [Saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html). In order to be reliable, each step of a saga must atomically update the database and publish messages/events. Alternatively, it might use the [Domain event pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html), perhaps to implement [CQRS](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html). In either case, it is not viable to use a distributed transaction that spans the database and the message broker to atomically update the database and publish messages/events.

## Problem
How to reliably/atomically update the database and publish messages/events.

## Forces
- 2PC is not an option

## Solution
A good solution to this problem is to use event sourcing. Event sourcing persists the state of a business entity such an Order or a Customer as a sequence of state-changing events. Whenever the state of a business entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events. Since saving an event is a single operation, it is inherently atomic. The application reconstructs an entityâ€™s current state by replaying the events.

Applications persist events in an event store, which is a database of events. The store has an API for adding and retrieving an entityâ€™s events. The event store also behaves like a message broker. It provides an API that enables services to subscribe to events. When a service saves an event in the event store, it is delivered to all interested subscribers.

Some entities, such as a Customer, can have a large number of events. In order to optimize loading, an application can periodically save a snapshot of an entityâ€™s current state. To reconstruct the current state, the application finds the most recent snapshot and the events that have occurred since that snapshot. As a result, there are fewer events to replay.

## Example
[Customers and Orders](https://github.com/eventuate-examples/eventuate-examples-java-customers-and-orders) is an example of an application that is built using Event Sourcing and [CQRS](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html). The application is written in Java, and uses Spring Boot. It is built using [Eventuate](http://eventuate.io/), which is an application platform based on event sourcing and CQRS.

The following diagram shows how it persist orders.
![Event Sourcing Example](/img/microService/eventSourcingPattern/example.png)

Instead of simply storing the current state of each order as a row in an __ORDERS__ table, the application persists each __Order__ as a sequence of events. The __CustomerService__ can subscribe to the order events and update its own state.

Here is the __Order__ aggregate:
```java
public class Order extends ReflectiveMutableCommandProcessingAggregate<Order, OrderCommand> {

  private OrderState state;
  private String customerId;

  public OrderState getState() {
    return state;
  }

  public List<Event> process(CreateOrderCommand cmd) {
    return EventUtil.events(new OrderCreatedEvent(cmd.getCustomerId(), cmd.getOrderTotal()));
  }

  public List<Event> process(ApproveOrderCommand cmd) {
    return EventUtil.events(new OrderApprovedEvent(customerId));
  }

  public List<Event> process(RejectOrderCommand cmd) {
    return EventUtil.events(new OrderRejectedEvent(customerId));
  }

  public void apply(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
    this.state = OrderState.CREATED;
    this.customerId = event.getCustomerId();
  }

  public void apply(OrderApprovedEvent event) {
    this.state = OrderState.APPROVED;
  }


  public void apply(OrderRejectedEvent event) {
    this.state = OrderState.REJECTED;
  }
```

Here is an example of an event handler in the __CustomerService__ that subscribes to __Order__ events:
```java
@EventSubscriber(id = "customerWorkflow")
public class CustomerWorkflow {

  @EventHandlerMethod
  public CompletableFuture<EntityWithIdAndVersion<Customer>> reserveCredit(
          EventHandlerContext<OrderCreatedEvent> ctx) {
    OrderCreatedEvent event = ctx.getEvent();
    Money orderTotal = event.getOrderTotal();
    String customerId = event.getCustomerId();
    String orderId = ctx.getEntityId();

    return ctx.update(Customer.class, customerId, new ReserveCreditCommand(orderTotal, orderId));
  }

}
```

It processes an __OrderCreated__ event by attempting to reserve credit for the orders customer.

There are [several example applications](http://eventuate.io/exampleapps.html) that illustrate how to use event sourcing.

## Resulting Context
Event sourcing has several benefits:
- It solves one of the key problems in implementing an event-driven architecture and makes it possible to reliably publish events whenever state changes.
- Because it persists events rather than domain objects, it mostly avoids the objectâ€‘relational impedance mismatch problem.
- It provides a 100% reliable [audit log](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/audit-logging) of the changes made to a business entity
- It makes it possible to implement temporal queries that determine the state of an entity at any point in time.
- Event sourcing-based business logic consists of loosely coupled business entities that exchange events. This makes it a lot easier to migrate from a monolithic application to a microservice architecture.

Event sourcing also has several drawbacks:
- It is a different and unfamiliar style of programming and so there is a learning curve.
- The event store is difficult to query since it requires typical queries to reconstruct the state of the business entities. That is likely to be complex and inefficient. As a result, the application must use [Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) to implement queries. This in turn means that applications must handle eventually consistent data.


## Related Patterns
- The [Saga](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) and [Domain event](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/domain-event.html) patterns create the need for this pattern.
- The [CQRS](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) must often be used with event sourcing.
- Event sourcing implements the [Audit logging](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/audit-logging) pattern.
