## 1. Overview
Spring Boot allows us to import sample data into our database â€“ mainly to prepare data for integration tests. Out of the box, there are two possibilities. __We can use *import.sql* (Hibernate support) or *data.sql* (Spring JDBC support) files to load data__.

However, sometimes we want to split one big SQL file into a few smaller ones, e.g., for better readability or to share some files with an init data between modules.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll show how to do it with both â€“ Hibernate and Spring JDBC.

## 2. Hibernate Support
We can define files which contain __sample data to load with a property *spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.import_files*__. It can be set in the application.properties file inside the test resources folder.

This is in a case we want to load sample data just for JUnit tests. The value has to be a comma-separated list of files to import:
```
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.import_files=import_active_users.sql,import_inactive_users.sql
```

This configuration will load sample data from two files: _import_active_users.sql_ and _import_inactive_users.sql_. Important to mention here is that we __have to use prefix *spring.jpa.properties* to pass values (JPA configuration) to the EntityManagerFactory__.

Next, weâ€™ll show how we can do it with a Spring JDBC support.

## 3. Spring JDBC Support
The configuration for initial data and __Spring JDBC support is very similar to Hibernate. We have to use the *spring.datasource.data*__ property:
```
spring.datasource.data=import_active_users.sql,import_inactive_users.sql
```

Setting the value as above gives the same results as in the Hibernate support. However, a significant __advantage of this solution is a possibility to define value using an Ant-style pattern:__
```
spring.datasource.data=import_*_users.sql
```

The above value tells the Spring to search for all files with a name that matches *import_\*_users.sql* pattern and import data which is inside.

## 4. Conclusion
In this short article, we showed how to configure Spring Boot application to load initial data from custom SQL files.

Finally, we showed two possibilities â€“ Hibernate and Spring JDBC. They both work pretty well, and itâ€™s up to the developer which one to chose.

As always, the complete code examples used in this article is available over on [Github](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/master/persistence-modules/spring-boot-persistence).
