## 1. Explicit vs Automatic String Conversion
Explicit String conversion ways include:
- Use of the toString() method of an object, especially wrapper classes.
- Use of the static overloaded method String.valueOf, passing in the other data type value.
- Use of a String constructor to convert a byte array as a String.

Automatic String conversion of other data type values happen when objects are used in the context of a String like:
- An object or primitive passed as an argument to a println().
- An object or primitive written as the second operand of the ‚Äú+ operator‚Äù when the first operand is a String.

## 2. Code for examples
We will use the below variable declarations for our examples inside a class `StringCheck`:
```java
public class StringCheck {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int i=10;

    char[] myCharArray = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };

    int[] myIntArray={1,2,3,4};

    byte myByteArray[] = "abcd".getBytes();

    //Code for each case will go here.

  }

}
```

## 3. Use of the toString() method
The toString() method is part of the Object class that should return a String representation of the object and hence inherited by all classes in Java. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method. Invoking toString() on a null reference will cause NullPointerException to be thrown.

Example:
```java
    System.out.println(new Integer(i).toString());

    System.out.println(new StringCheck().toString());

    System.out.println(myCharArray.toString());

    System.out.println(myIntArray.toString());

    System.out.println(myByteArray.toString());
```

This will print:
```java
10

StringCheck@1a8c4e7

[C@9664a1

[I@13e8d89

[B@1be2d65
```
Explanation of the above print out:
- The [ means array.
- The C means char.
- The @ separates the type from the ID.
- The unsigned hex digits are an object ID or hashcode.

Below is a list of possible values for most types.
- B - byte
- C - char
- D - double
- F - float
- I - int
- J - long
- S - short
- Z - boolean
- [ - one [ for every dimension of the array

## 4. Use of String.valueOf
The static overloaded method String.valueOf returns the string representation of the argument data.

String.valueOf() is overloaded for all the primitive types, char array and for the type Object.

For the primitive types, valueOf() returns the string representation of the of the value it contains.

For objects including arrays, but excluding char[], if the argument is null, then a string equal to "null"; otherwise, the value of obj.toString() is returned.

<ins>For char array, if the argument is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown; otherwise it will print the contents of the char array.</ins>

Example:
```java
    System.out.println(String.valueOf(i));

    System.out.println(String.valueOf(new StringCheck()));

    System.out.println(String.valueOf(myCharArray));

    System.out.println(String.valueOf(myIntArray));

    System.out.println(String.valueOf(myByteArray));
```

This will produce the output:
```java
10

StringCheck@13e8d89

abc

[I@1be2d65

[B@9664a1
```
You can see that except for character arrays, everything is printed as is for toString(); for char arrays, the contents are printed instead.

## 5. Converting a byte array to String using String constructor
Using the  String.valueOf or the toString method of object will work for primitives and wrappers, but not for objects and arrays. For most objects, we need to override the toString. We also saw that a char array contents are converted with String.valueOf.

We can convert a byte array contents to String using a String constructor as:
```java
    System.out.println(new String(myByteArray).toString());
```
This will print:
```java
abcd
```
Note that toString is overridden for the String class.

You can also specify the charset for conversion using another overloaded String constructor:
```java
System.out.println(new String(myByteArray, "UTF-8").toString());
```
This can throw an UnsupportedEncodingException. To know more about charsets and endocings, refer to [javajee.com/charset-and-encodings](javajee.com/charset-and-encodings).

## 6. Automatic string conversion inside println method
Java converts any object into its string representation inside a println() by calling one of the overloaded versions of the String.valueOf() method.

Example:
```java
    System.out.println(i);

    System.out.println(new StringCheck());

    System.out.println(myCharArray);

    System.out.println(myIntArray);

    System.out.println(myByteArray);
```
This will output:
```java
10

StringCheck@1a8c4e7

abc

[I@1be2d65

[B@9664a1
```
Note that the output is exactly same as that of `String.valueOf`.

## 7. Automatic String conversion when using String concatenation operator +
Java doesn't allow operator overloading yet, + is overloaded for class String. When you add a non-string operand such as an integer or char to a String, the non-string operand is converted to a string and string concatenation happens. String conversion using concatenation operator for object references, which include all array types, is defined as follows: If the reference is null, it is converted to the string "null". Otherwise, the conversion is performed as if by an invocation of the toString method of the referenced object with no arguments; but if the result of invoking the toString method is null, then the string "null" is used instead. The string concatenation operator + makes use of toString directly whereas println makes use of String.valueOf and gives special treatment to char arrays. StringBuffer.append() also gives special treatement for char[] through overloading.

Example:
```java
    System.out.println(""+i);

    System.out.println(""+new StringCheck());

    System.out.println(""+myCharArray);

    System.out.println(""+myIntArray);

    System.out.println(""+myByteArray);
```

This will print:
```
10

StringCheck@1729854

[C@cf2c80

[I@1be2d65

[B@9664a1
```
Note that the output is exactly same as that of toString() invocation.
